# Third-party notices

Frametell is licensed under the [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE). It is built on, and the desktop app ships, the open-source
software below. Each keeps its own licence and copyright; the full texts are in each package (in the app, under
`Resources/app/node_modules/<package>/`), and the licence comments of code bundled into the app's main process are kept
in `Resources/app/dist/main.js.LEGAL.txt`.

## FFmpeg

The desktop app runs FFmpeg as a separate program in `Resources/bin`. It is not part of Frametell. It is a static
build with no nonfree parts, licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3**. Its licence, version, build
configuration and where to get its source are in `Resources/bin/FFMPEG-NOTICE.txt` and `Resources/bin/COPYING.GPLv3`.

- FFmpeg: <https://ffmpeg.org> (source: <https://ffmpeg.org/releases/>)
- macOS builds: <https://ffmpeg.martin-riedl.de> (build script: <https://git.martin-riedl.de/ffmpeg/build-script>)
- When run from source, Frametell uses the binary from [ffmpeg-static](https://github.com/eugeneware/ffmpeg-static)
  (GPL-3.0-or-later), which the desktop app does not ship.
